    <comment>Live from Stav's office where they let us use one of the conference rooms, official Cum Boy Adam Friedland (@AdamFriedland) joins us to discuss cumming in his own face and why he can't cum on other faces now. We talk about how Muslims go to the bathroom (but not in a racist way), Youtube comments(in a racist way), Chaturbate,and Iran (also racist). Also includesa special appearance by New York comedian Seth Dickfield and other rude caricatures.</comment>

    <comment>The 8th episode. We get really, really deep into this whole Brexit thing. Really insightful takes about Jeremy Corvair and Johnathan Primbles or whoever. And the guy with the hair. We had to use a conference room so theres an echo that makes this one almost unlistenable. Thanks.</comment>
